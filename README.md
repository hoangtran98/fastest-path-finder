<h1>Fastest Path Finder App</h1>
<p>This contains source code implementation of Dijkstra algorithm in the format of web application. It's written on the top of base project from GeekForGeek personal project online course.</p>
<h2>How does this app work?</h2>
<ol>
<li>You need to pick your start node</li>
<li>You need to pick your destination node</li>
<li>You can optionally build wall as barriers between these above nodes</li>
<li>Run algorithm to find the shorest path</li>
</ol>
<h2>Quick demo</h2>
