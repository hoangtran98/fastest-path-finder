<h1>Fastest Path Finder App</h1>
<p>This contains source code implementation of Dijkstra algorithm in the format of web application. It's writtent on the top of base project from GeekForGeek personal project online course.</p>
<h2>How does this app work</h2>
1. You need to pick your start node
2. You need to pick your destination node
3. You can optionally build wall as barriers between these above nodes
4. Run algorithm to find the shorest path
